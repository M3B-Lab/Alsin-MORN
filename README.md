### Repo Structure

The repository is organized in the following folders:

 * `MDP/`

  This folder contains the MD simulation parameters in GROMACS MDP format used for minimization, stepwise equilibration and production MD simulation.

 * `Topologies/`

  This folder contains the molecular topologies for the Alsin monomer, L-ALS and V-ALS conformations.

 * `SimulationInput/`

  This folder contains the input files for the production of MD simulations (after NVT+NPT equilibration; one tpr per replica).
